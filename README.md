- GitHub Copilot steals the work of open-source devs! I will probably migrate to GitLab...
- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMuniz1 a.k.a Alexandre Muniz
- Currently a Software Engineering student at UniCesumar EAD.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software developer(not only mobile, but messing with PC architecture as well). 
- Not so much interested in Web development, except for WebAssembly. We'll see
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Assembly and C++. Already know Scientific Python, thanks to an old University course I dropout(Applied Mathematics UFRJ/Brazil)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FLOSS projects. 
-   Years as a Linux user made me very grateful for all the open source projects I use, I want to give back by contributing my knowledge and my time in any way.
